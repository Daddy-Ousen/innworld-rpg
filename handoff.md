# Handoff

## Just done (2026-09-27)
- M11.1 merged ([PR #47](https://github.com/Daddy-Ousen/innworld-rpg/pull/47)); tag `m11.1-done` on 84eab06 (pushed).
- M11.2 Characters built on branch `feat/m11.2-characters` ([PR #48](https://github.com/Daddy-Ousen/innworld-rpg/pull/48) open). Detail: ADR 0018 "M11.2".
  - `game/data/appearance.json`: 43 looks. Every NPC in `npc_behaviour.json` has its own look; 8 `race_*` generic looks.
    Facts come from a subagent check of the Books 1-4 text (chapter refs in each `note`).
  - New value kinds (shape unchanged; the user sees them with the PR): `race_<race>` look ids, `all.lpcr.<name>` colours,
    `innworld_*` edit parts (Antinium arms, antennae, mandibles, drawn by `tools/build_sprites.py`).
  - Code: `CharacterSprite.look_for(id, race)`; `WorldView.setup(..., races)` (last arg); `main.gd` passes canon races.
  - Tests: GUT 708/708 (76 scripts), Python 64/64, validator 0 errors. Screenshots sent to the user.

## Next steps
1. User checks the look and merges the M11.2 PR. Then tick M11.2 in ROADMAP and `progress.md`, tag `m11.2-done` on the merge commit.
2. Possible polish (ask the user): Antinium back shell; Toren's blue eye-flames; per-book looks (Klbkch two arms after 1.63, Toren purple flames after 3.17T) would need a look switch by flag (a schema change).
3. M11.3 Animation: NPC and monster facing from their last move, walk cycle for NPCs, attack swing, hit flash, damage numbers, knock-out fall.
   Many LPC weapons have walk frames but no slash frames: the weapon vanishes in a swing. Fix in M11.3 (for example use the
   LPC `1h_slash`/`thrust` animations, or hide the weapon layer in the walk rows).

## How to rebuild art
- Object edits: `python tools/build_objects.py` then `godot --headless --path game --import`. Append new edits at the END of `EDITS` (the order sets the regions in objects.json). Print regions with `--print`.
- Character sheets: the LPC generator part clone is in the session scratchpad (gone next session). Make a new one
  (the fastest: all parts, only the 4 animations we use; about 100 MB, 30 s):
  `MSYS_NO_PATHCONV=1 git -C ulpc sparse-checkout add '/spritesheets/**/walk.png' '/spritesheets/**/slash.png' '/spritesheets/**/hurt.png' '/spritesheets/**/idle.png' '/spritesheets/**/walk/' '/spritesheets/**/slash/' '/spritesheets/**/hurt/' '/spritesheets/**/idle/'`
  Or part by part:
  `git clone --depth 1 --filter=blob:none --sparse https://github.com/LiberatedPixelCup/Universal-LPC-Spritesheet-Character-Generator.git ulpc`
  then in Git Bash use `MSYS_NO_PATHCONV=1 git -C ulpc sparse-checkout set --no-cone /CREDITS.csv /LICENSE /palette_definitions/ /sheet_definitions/` and `... sparse-checkout add /spritesheets/<part folder>/` for each part folder (the folder is `layer_1.<body>` in the part's sheet definition).
- `python tools/build_sprites.py --ulpc <clone>` then `godot --headless --path game --import`.
- Without `MSYS_NO_PATHCONV=1`, Git Bash turns `/palette_definitions/` into `C:/Program Files/Git/...`.

## Waiting on the user
- Check the M11.2 character looks (screenshots) and the new appearance.json value kinds, merge its PR.
- Delete old remote branches `data/book4-*` (optional).

## Gotchas
- Commits and PRs: author Daddy-Ousen only. NO `Co-Authored-By: Claude` trailer, no Claude footer.
- **Never use `sed -i` in Git Bash on repo files** - it strips CRLF. All working-copy text files are CRLF (autocrlf=true). Patch with Python on bytes (keep CRLF) or with the Edit tool. Do NOT normalise whole folders.
- `Commands.wait(gs, db, seconds)` takes SECONDS. The clock does pass midnight while awake, but the director only runs on sleep (`Commands.sleep(gs, db, Rest.ANYWHERE)`). Wake time is 6:00, so a stage before 6 is only reachable by staying up.
- A GUT test helper named `_set` clashes with `Object._set` (parse error).
- A stage starts only while its event is pending, the player is on the stage area, inside its hours and its `when_flags` hold (`Stage.is_open`).
- Scene stages place NPCs even off their schedule, but every placed NPC needs an `npc_behaviour` entry.
- Clearing an old "away" flag can wake an old schedule: 3.24 clears `horns_of_hammerad.gone_to_albez`, which put Pisces back on the Floodplains at night; fixed with `unless_flags` in_celum / left_celum.
- Talking to an NPC next to you gives `talk_with_guest` / `persuade` / `comfort_someone` (rules.npc.talk_actions) with the map's location as context; talking adds +1 relationship.
- Screenshots: a throwaway scene in `game/_scratch/` that adds `world/main.tscn` as a child (`add_child.call_deferred`), run with `godot --path game res://_scratch/shot.tscn`. Delete `game/_scratch` before committing.
- New `class_name` scripts need `godot --headless --path game --import` once.
- `-gtest=` is ignored; use `-gselect=<script name> -gdir=res://tests`.
- GUT exits 0 even on a parse error - grep for `Parse Error` and check the script count (76 now).
- Validator: `python tools/validate_data.py game/data/canon --all` (the folder with book<N> in it, not a book folder).
- Toy dbs erase `rules.economy`; real-db tests have hunger on.
- Rhir is real; Calruz stays missing; never link two canon entities unless the text says so (Ylawes is Yvlon's brother: 3.24 says so).
- Book 3 "E" chapters are Laken, not Erin. Laken, Geneva, Niers (3.22L) and Venitra use placeholder days.
- Save is v13 (M10.0 portal trips). `MapDb` holds maps in `areas`; use `objects_on(area)` or `objects_near`, not `areas[a]['objects']`, so flag-hidden objects stay hidden. Enemy `danger` must be 0.0–1.0.
- Same-day canon order: chain with `depends_on`. Siblings that share one dependency run in id order, so a sibling can clear a flag another still `requires` (M10.1: the rescue cleared `mrsha.fell_into_the_dungeon` before Toren's event). Debug with a throwaway `extends SceneTree` script that prints `gs.world.history` reasons. Helper-only waves come at once when no foe is left; put helper waves before the last foe wave.

- Octavia matters to Book 3: killing her before day 87 cancels 3.25's goodbye and the wagon leaving, which cascades. Kill tests for her must run after day 87.
- Scene stages: `Stage.place_npc` skips an NPC who is already in the stage area, so that NPC stays at their own post (M10.3: Lyonette, Mrsha in the inn). Only NPCs brought in from elsewhere take the stage tile. Hooks that need an NPC next to the player must name NPCs that really are placed.
- Scene `when_flags` are read during the day, before the night's events run: use a flag that is set by an earlier night.
- Python patching: converting line ends twice (LF to CRLF on a string that already has CRLF) leaves a stray CR, and git then shows the file as `-text` and changed in full. Check `git ls-files --eol` after patching.
- Never write a bash `cat > "$UNSET_VAR/..."` line without a heredoc: it waits on stdin and hangs the shell.

- Director dependencies are hard: an event whose `depends_on` was cancelled is cancelled too. Chain events only to events that always happen, or one dead NPC cancels a whole day (M10.4 cut the chains this way). Siblings run in id order, so name ids to sort in story order.
- Effects and scene flags: a flag set by an event on day N is visible on day N+1. An event set and cleared in the same night never shows in a schedule (`erin.at_esthelm`).
- Fight-stage tests: a helper that walks to `Pathfind.around(at)` can stop on a diagonal square and never attack. Walk to the four side squares instead (`sim_book4_christmas._fight_turn`). Strong allies that arrive at once can kill weak foes before the player strikes; delay the ally wave.
- A throwaway `extends SceneTree` script that errors before `quit()` hangs Godot headless forever. Use `_initialize()`, and run with `timeout 300`.

## Graphics notes (M11)
- Core must not change for art. The view compares old and new state after each command and plays tweens; tweens never block input.
- Missing art must fall back to today's squares, so headless tests and new data never break.
- `.import` and `.uid` files are kept in git (ADR 0001). Run `godot --headless --path game --import` after adding art or scripts.
- The player marker moves at once; only the `CharacterSprite` child glides (tests read `player.position`).
- Monster markers must stay squares until M11.4: `unit_world_view` checks their child order (edge, ring, body, label, bar).
- LPC tile packs: `lpc_terrains` fills: grass (1,10) + tufts (0..2,12), light grass tufts (3..4,12), dirt (1,3)/(1,5), grey cobble (13,3), snow (22,10)/(21..22,12), water (1,17), frozen dirt (25,12). `lpc_atlas`: pine (30,0,2,5), round tree (29,28,3,4), grey rock (28,26,1,1), stone wall face (17,24).
- Screenshots: `godot --path game --write-movie <file>.png --fixed-fps 10 --quit-after 12 res://_scratch/shot.tscn` (window is 1152x648; `--resolution` is ignored).
- M11.1 shot scene: a `_scratch/shot.gd` that makes a WorldView, a `GameState.new(1)`, `gs.player.place(AREA, pos)`, `v.refresh(gs)`, and sets `v.camera.zoom` (0.8 shows a whole 32x24 map). Read AREA/X/Y/ZOOM/WINTER from env vars. Winter: pass "winter" as the winter flag to `setup` and set `gs.flags["winter"]`.
- Terrain block layout (`lpc_terrains`, 3x6): rows 0-1 inner corners (SE gap (1,0), SW (2,0), NE (1,1), NW (2,1)), rows 2-4 ring, row 5 fills. Blocks used: dirt (0,0), cave (15,0), chasm (24,0), grass (0,7), light grass (3,7), snow wall (18,7), snow (21,7), frozen dirt (24,7), shallows water (0,14), light sea (24,14).
- Object regions are PIXELS in objects.json (tile props in tiles.json are CELLS).
- Picking art: a scratch `zoom.py` (crop + 16 px grid + px labels) was the fastest way to read exact pixel rects.

- Weapon parts keep one file per colour (walk/<colour>.png): they need a `color` (sword "steel", spear "iron", waraxe "waraxe", dagger "dagger", staff "simple"). The `muscular` body has almost no clothes: use `male`.
- A look preview is fastest with a scratch `preview.py` that imports `build_sprites` and pastes the standing frames of each look into one image.
- Screenshots of NPCs: `_scratch/shot.gd` must be the script of a `_scratch/shot.tscn` (running the .gd alone opens the title menu). Fill `gs.npcs.npcs[id] = {"area", "x", "y", "facing"}` by hand to line up many NPCs.
- Godot `--import` rewrites some old `.import` files with LF; they show as changed with no content diff. `git checkout -- game/assets/objects game/assets/tiles` before committing.
